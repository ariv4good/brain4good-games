# Game Plan
* N-Queen puzzle game
    * Board array to access any square rect object
    * Click listeners for square rect objects - Alert row, col of clicked square
    * Data structure to hold position of pieces in board
    * Queen's possible moves computation
* Upgrade to N-Piece puzzle game
    * Other piece's possible moves computation
* Move images from png to svg
* moblie responsiveness
* Able to use in mock interview

# Development Best Practices
* Goal - Easy team work
* Proper git usage
* Git license - code by others - rights
* Proper documentation - Less learning curve for newbie
    * comment all known things
    * get more knowledge in unknown things
    * Do actual react documentation
* Proper MVC
    * Default values for IBoardConfig
    * images folder
    * drawChessBoard function in Board.tsx
* Cleanup the project - there shouldn't be any unecessary things in project
    * Public folder
    * Root folder

# Performance optimization
* Data structures
* Algorithms
* Reduce Build size - less data consumed for end user
* Lazy Loading - quick download of mandatory components

# drawings
* merging the drawing API code and the rest (integration): similar
* ease of use:
    * (with library) canvas = webGL
    * (from scratch) webGL << canvas
* speed: webGL > canvas
* capabilities: webGL > canvas
* cost: webGL is much more expensive
* platform: very similar

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
